            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git basically shows the history of changes that users make on a file. Git is able to identify who made edits, what edits were made, when they were made, and so much more. You are able to have multiple people work on a file at a time and can merge content together once each individual is done adding to the file. Git is incredibly efficient because multiple users are able to work at the same time. Git is also one of the fastest of its kind, which is pretty impressive since it is only seven years old. It is also very user friendly to people of all backgrounds in the information technology field. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">I never have use Git previously, so I wanted to provide a brief overview about what it is. Git and Github is a version control system (VCS) that operates without having to be connected to the internet at all times. It is able to be saved within itself and then exported out to the internet at a later time. It also saves your data only when you make updates because it saves data as a group snapshot rather than individual interactions. Git only relies on its own structure, so users do not need to worry about being connected to a network. I found this interesting because I had never thought that these systems needed to actively be connected to an outside network and Git has opened my eyes to this method.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git, along with other version control systems, have various states of collecting and understanding files. Git relies on three stages: committed, modified, and staged. The committed state refers to when data files are saved into the database of your choosing. This basically means that your files are saved and exported to where you have directed them. The modified state refers to data files that you have edited and not exported yet. This is the stage before committed, so you need to always make sure you are saving and exporting your work! The staged state refers to a modified data file, in its current state, to go into the committed state.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Utilizing a Git Repository is one of the best parts of using Git. You can first start by acquiring your repository by either making a local directory into a Git repository or make a copy of a previous Git repository. If you are looking to connect a directory with Git, you must connect files within the two. Once you connect them, you are able to track any changes made to the files. If you chose to clone an existing repository, it is a longer process. The easiest way is to use the SSH transfer protocol and add Git to an already existing server.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Tracking Changes</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is specialized to track changes made in files between multiple users. There are two states that a file can be in: tracked and untracked. It is increasingly important to understand the difference between the two because Git relies more on tracked files rather than untracked. Tracked files are ones that were previously saved and are in the last snapshot that Git took. They can also be in any state (unmodified, modified or staged). Untracked files are any file besides tracked files. Untracked files are not apart of the last snapshot that Git took or the last time you saved. Therefore, Git cannot do anything with these because they have not been changed. </p>
